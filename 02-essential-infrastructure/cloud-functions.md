# Cloud Functions

- Cloud Functions is a serverless computing platform designed to run single-purpose pieces of code in response to events in the GCP environment
- There is no need to provision or manage VMs, containers, or clusters when using Cloud Functions
- Cloud Functions provides the "glue" between services that are otherwise independent

## Cloud Functions Execution Environment

- The functions execute in a secure, isolated execution environment
- Compute resources scale as needed to run as many instances of Cloud Functions as needed without you having to do anything to control scaling
- The execution of one function is independent of all others. The lifecycles of Cloud Functions are not dependent on each other
