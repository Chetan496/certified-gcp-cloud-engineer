# VPC - Virtual Private Cloud

- Projects are the key organizer of infrastructure resources in Google Cloud. Prior to VPCs there were legacy networks which are now deprecated
- A project can contain multiple VPC networks
- The default quota for each project is 5 networks
- VPC Networks can be shared or peered with other networks
- These VPC networks do not have IP ranges(whereas AWS VPC networks have IP ranges). Google Cloud networks are global and span across all available regions (whereas AWS VPC networks are regional)
- Inside networks we can segregate resources in subnetworks. Subnets and subnetworks refer to the same term
- There are 3 types of networks:
    - Default: every project is provided with a default network. This network has a subnet in each region with non-overlapping CIDR ranges and default firewall rules (SSH, RDP, ICMP from anywhere and egress traffic to anywhere)
    - Auto: one subnet for each region is automatically created in it. These subnets usa a /20 mask which can be expanded up to a /16 mask. All this subnets fit in the 10.0.0.0/9 CIDR block. If new region become available, new subnets are added to the network
    - Custom: does not automatically create subnets. We are fully in control about the IP ranges for the subnets, region where they are created
- An auto-mod network can be converted to custom, but not vice-versa
- Subnets works at a regional scale. Subnets can cross zones.
- Subnets are regional resources
- Subnets are assigned an IP range. The first and second addresses from the range are reserved for the network and subnet gateway
- Other reserved addresses are the second to last and the last addresses (broadcast IP addresses)
- Subnets can be extended without any downtime. They cannot shrink
- In case of extension the new subnet mask should not overlap with any other subnet range from the network
- Auto mode subnets can be extended from /20 to /16
- Dual stack subnets - means subnets who have both IPV4 and IPV6 address ranges. Compute instances can also be given both the address ranges

## IP Addresses

- In GCP each VM can have 2 IP addresses:
    - An internal IP address allocated by DHCP. Any VM or any service which depends on an IP address (example App Engine, GKE) gets this internal IP address
    - External IP address (optional): we can address this IP address if the service requires it. We can assign this IP address from a pool or from a reserved ip address (static). If we have allocate a static IP address and not assign it to a machine, we are charged for it
- We can use our publicly routable IP addresses with bringing into GPC a /24 IP block or larger (BYOIP)

## DNS Resolution for Internal Addresses

- Each instance has a hostname that can be resolved to an internal IP address:
    - The hostname is the same as the instance name
    - FQDN is `[hostname].[zone].c.[project-id].internal`
- Name resolution is handled by internal DNS resolver:
    - Provided as part of the Compute Engine (`169.254.169.254`)
    - Configured for use on instance via DHCP
    - Provides answers for internal and external addresses

## DNS Resolution for external Addresses

- Instances with external IP address connections from hosts outside the project
- DNS records for external addresses can be published using existing DNS servers (outside of Google Cloud)
- DNS zones can be hosted using Cloud DNS

## Cloud DNS

- It a scalable, reliable, managed authoritative domain name system (DNS service)
- It is using Google's global network of anycast nameservers to serve DNS zones
- GCP offers an 100% update SLA for Cloud DNS
- Cloud DNS allows creation and update of million DNS records without the burden of managing own DNS servers

## Alias IP Ranges

- Allows us to assign a range of IP addresses as aliases to a VM's network interface
- Useful if want to assign multiple IP addresses to VM in case we are running multiple applications on it (example: containers)

## Routes and Firewalls

- By default every network has:
    - Routes that let instances in a network send traffic directly connect to each other
    - A default route that directs packets to destinations that are outside of the network
- The default network firewall rules configured to allow instances on a network talk to each other. Manually created networks do not have such rules
- Instance routing tables:
    - Each route in the routes collection may apply to one or more instances
    - A route applies to an instance if the network and the instance tag match with the rule
    - If there are no tags specified for the rule, it will apply to all the instances from the network
- GCP firewall rules protect our VM instances form unapproved connections
- GCP firewall rules are stateful
- Firewall rule properties:
    - direction: ingress or egress rules
    - source or destination
    - protocol and port
    - action: allow or deny packets that match the direction, protocol, port and source destination of the rule
    - priority
    - Rule assignment: all rules are assigned to all instances, but we can assign certain rules to certain instances only

## Network Pricing

- Ingress traffic is free (responses to requests are considered egress traffic which is charged)
- Egress traffic to the same zone (internal IP address) is free
- Egress traffic to Google products (Youtube, Maps, Drive) is free
- Egress traffic to GCP services within the same region is free, with some exceptions
- Egress traffic to the same same region: $0.01/GB
- Egress traffic to the same zone using external IP address: $0.01/GB
- Egress traffic between regions in the US and Canada: $0.01/GB
- Egress traffic between regions outside of US: varies by region
- Price of static IP addresses (assigned but not used): $0.01 per hour
- Static and ephemeral IP addresses in use on standard VM: $0.004 per hour
- Static and ephemeral IP addresses in use on preemptible VM: $0.002 per hour
- Static adn ephemeral IP addresses attached to forwarding rules are free of charge
