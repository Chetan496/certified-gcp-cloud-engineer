# Infrastructure Automation

## Terraform

- Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool, allowing us to quickly provision and remove infrastructures
- It provides the following features:
    - A repeatable deployment process
    - A declarative language
    - Parallel deployments
    - Template-drive infrastructure

## Google Cloud Marketplace

- Let's us quickly deploy production-grade solutions from third party vendors, who already made their deployment configurations based on Terraform
- Google Cloud automatically updates the images provided on the marketplace, but it does not upgrade already deployed infrastructure
- Google Cloud Marketplace provides direct access to partner support
