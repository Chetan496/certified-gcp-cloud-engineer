# API Management Tools

## Cloud Endpoints

- Distributed API management through API console
- Used to expose our API using RESTful interface
- It is an easy to deploy proxy in front of the back-end services
- We can control access and validate calls with JSON Web Tokens and Google API keys
- We can generate cloud libraries

## ApiGee Edge

- Focuses on business problems: rate limiting, quotas, analytics
- Contains monetization and developer portal
- The backend services does not need to be in GCP (can be used for legacy applications and cloud migrations)
